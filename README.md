# Sushiman Sushi Ordering Landing Page üç£

Welcome to the repository for the Sushiman project, an appetizing online solution crafted to deliver a delightful sushi ordering experience through a beautifully designed landing page.

The goal was to create an immersive, yet elegant, online platform capable of capturing the finesse of sushi artistry in web form. As a proactive learner and budding web developer, I chose to develop this landing page to further enrich my understanding and mastery of web development principles and techniques.

## Project Overview üìã

The project was designed to be a fully responsive landing page, gracefully adapting to various devices, while capturing the user's attention with tasteful animations.

## Key Features & Functionality üîë

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is built to respond and adapt to different screen sizes, delivering a seamless user experience across multiple devices.
- **Animations**: Subtle and smooth animations were used to bring the sushi ordering experience to life, enhancing user interaction. This was achieved using the AOS (Animate on Scroll) library.
- **Clean and Organized Code**: The project strictly adheres to the principles of writing clean, readable, and maintainable code, as well as maintaining a well-structured file and folder organization.
- **CSS Techniques**: Usage of CSS variables, imports, and flex and position properties allowed for sophisticated and reusable styling.
- **BEM Naming Method**: Adherence to the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming method ensured the stylesheets remained consistent and manageable.

## Technical Stack üíª

The frontend of the application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Vite, a modern front-end build tool, was employed to develop a fast and lean development environment. AOS (Animate on Scroll) was used for the smooth, beautiful animations on the landing page.

The Sushiman sushi ordering landing page stands as a testimony to my abilities as a web developer, adeptly balancing design aesthetics, user interaction, and code efficiency.
